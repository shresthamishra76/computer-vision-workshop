# CV Workshop — Image Classifier

**OpenCV + GoogLeNet (ImageNet) · Beginner Computer Vision Workshop**

---

## Getting Started

First, you will need to fork this repo, ensuring your fork is public

Then, work on the code in this repo, try to get as much done as you can!

Finally, answer the questions listed at the bottom of the README to be entered into the raffle.

And most importantly, have fun!

## Setup

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Then download the model files (one-time, ~50 MB):

```bash
python download_model.py
```

Sample images are already included in `images/`.

## How to Work Through This

**Work in order: `utils.py` → `model.py` → `main.py`**

Each file has a self-test. Run it after you finish that file:

```bash
python utils.py    # must show all ✓ before moving to model.py
python model.py    # must show all ✓ before moving to main.py
python main.py     # runs the full pipeline
```

---

## Running the Classifier

```bash
# Default image
python main.py

# Specify image and expected label
python main.py --image images/cat.jpg --label cat
python main.py --image images/car.jpg --label "sports car"

# Classify every image in a folder
python main.py --batch images/
```

---

## The Pipeline

```
your_image.jpg
    ↓  load_image()
(H × W × 3)  BGR array
    ↓  preprocess()         grayscale → blur → Canny
(H × W)  binary edge map
    ↓  find_subject_contour()
largest qualifying contour
    ↓  crop_roi()
(h × w × 3)  color crop
    ↓  prepare_blob()
(1 × 3 × 224 × 224)  normalized tensor
    ↓  run_inference()
(1 × 1000)  confidence scores
    ↓  get_top_prediction()
"golden retriever"  94.3%
    ↓  draw_prediction()
annotated image on screen
```

## Some ImageNet Categories to Try

| Animals          | Vehicles      | Objects       | Food       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| golden retriever | sports car    | laptop        | pizza      |
| tabby cat        | school bus    | backpack      | banana     |
| bald eagle       | ambulance     | rocking chair | ice cream  |
| hammerhead shark | mountain bike | sunglasses    | coffee mug |

Check `synset_words.txt` for the full list of 1000 valid labels.

## Questions - MUST BE DONE TO ENTER RAFFLE

1. In your own words, explain why we preprocess the image with grayscale, blur, and edge detection before passing it to the model. What would happen if we skipped one of those steps?

Preprocessing (grayscale → blur → edges) simplifies the image so contour detection can find the subject reliably before classification. If you skip grayscale, blur, or edges, you usually get noisier or broken contours, which leads to a worse crop and weaker model predictions.

2. When you ran your classifier on an image, what did it predict and how confident was it? Did the result surprise you — and if it got something wrong, why do you think that happened?

On a sample run, the classifier predicted “Rottweiler” at about 21.9% confidence rate. This was a wrong inference mainly due to the lack of a sophisticated model with better accuracy. The model we used is a pre-trained GoogLeNet, which is not fine-tuned for our specific images. Additionally, the quality of the cropped region and the presence of background noise could have also contributed to the misclassification.

3. We focused on the top prediction (the supposed classification) — but the model outputs 1000 scores simultaneously. What does it mean that the scores for other classes are non-zero? What are those numbers telling you?

The other non-zero class scores mean the model sees partial evidence for multiple classes, not just one. Those values are the model’s confidence distribution across 1000 possibilities, showing which alternatives it thinks are plausible.

4. Where would you take this project next? Think about different models you could swap in, new kinds of images you'd want to classify, or features you'd add to make it more useful in the real world.

Next, I’d try a stronger modern model such as YOLO which would give much better bounding box accuracy and classification performance. I’d also want to classify more complex scenes with multiple objects, and add features like multi-label classification, object detection, or even caption generation. This is something YOLO is great at.
